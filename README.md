# Test Application #1

This project is a simple application that I tried to create as quickly as possible. By creating projects under a time constraint, I hope to improve upon my existing programming skills. 

This application simply creates a sklearn decision tree and saves it in a database. This can be accessed by the user to manually infer upon a model at a later point.
